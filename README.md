# Recipe_Manager
Foundations for building a list of recipes.
This is a recipe management system.  The user may create and edit their own list of ingredient categories, ingredients, and recipes.
From these lists, the user will be able to create a list of their favorite recipes.
Unit conversion for scaling up or down will also be an option for the user to determine the quantity of ingredients they need to purchse to feed a family of four or host a banquet of 4000.

wxWidgets is being used for GUI.

Next Steps (notes to self):
- Test Files need to be updated to correspond with current functionalities.
- refactor code, documentation. work in progress.
- start daily/weekly/monthly menu builds.
- make recipes scalable.
- incorporate grocery item linking to ingredients.
- compile shopping lists based on menu builds and ingredient:item links.
