# Recipe_Manager
Foundations for building a list of recipes.
This is a recipe management system.  The user may create and edit their own list of ingredient categories, ingredients, and recipes.
From these lists, the user will be able to create a list of their favorite recipes.
Unit conversion for scaling up or down will also be an option for the user to determine the quantity of ingredients they need to purchse to feed a family of four or host a banquet of 4000.

wxWidgets is being used for GUI.

05.04.21 update:
Categories: and add, modify, and remove categories with information translating to ingredients correctly.
Ingredients: can add, modify, and remove ingredients with information translating to recipes correctly.

Next Steps (notes to self):
- make it so that new frames stay on top of existing frames
- add missing fields for all frames that data types can hold (ie Recipe serving size, etc..)
- track data dumps
- refactor code
- make recipes scalable.
- start daily/weekly/monthly menu builds
- incorporate grocery item linking to ingredients
- compile shopping lists based on menu builds and ingredient:item links
