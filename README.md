# Recipe_Manager
Framework for building a list of recipes.
This is a recipe management system I started working on.  The idea is for it to be user-friendly (will add GUI later on) in that the user may create and edit their own list of ingredient categories, ingredients, and recipes.
From these lists, the user will be able to create a list of their favorite recipes.
Unit conversion for scaling up or down will also be an option for the user to determine the quantity of ingredients they need to purchse to feed a family of four or host a banquet of 4000 (should they desire to).
Once the framework is laid out and GUI is set up, I intend to update and incorporate my Grocery Tree project into the mix.
